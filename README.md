# Org Chart

Hi and welcome to the repository holding my version of the Org Chart Exercise. You will find the instructions in INSTRUCTIONS.md for reference.

I've decided to start from scratch rather than use an existing library or UI kit (such as tailwind) as I thought it'd be more appropriate for the purpose of this exercise.

## Project Setup

This is a simple Vue app created using Vue CLI. 
It is a TypeScript project, uses Pinia for state management and Prettier for formatting.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload

```sh
npm run dev
```

### E2E and Unit Tests

You can run both E2E and Unit tests. However, I have not spent much time on these, focusing only on their initial setup and basic functionality.

### If I had more time

I adhered to the estimated 3-4hours time limit for this exercise. If I had more time, I would have loved to finish writing tests, fine-tune the mobile version and improve the overall setup (TypeScript and the structure for example as this isn't my usual starter app).
